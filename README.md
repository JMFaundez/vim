# My vim configuration

* To have solarized working on the terminal I had to add the following 
line in my `.bashrc` file:

		sh ~/.vim/plugged/vim-solarized8/scripts/solarized8.sh
* To install the plugins:
		
		:PlugInstall
* And to remove them:

		:PlugClean
* To use the mouse as expected press shift (even for selection). Then you can go `ctrl+v`, `ctrl+c`, use the middle button to copy and paste and so on.

* Since wrapping is selected, use `gj` and `gk` to move along 'monitor' lines

* I created a vimswp directory to put the annoying swap and backup files
